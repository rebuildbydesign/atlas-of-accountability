# Atlas of Accountability

Welcome to the repository for the **Atlas of Accountability**, is an interactive map that visualizes the impact of FEMA's federally declared climate disasters across U.S. counties and congressional districts from 2011 to 2023, providing tools to explore disaster data, reveal county-specific impacts, and engage with representatives to promote resilient infrastructure initiatives.

## Mission

The mission of the Atlas of Disasters is to empower citizens, policymakers, and researchers with accurate and accessible geographical data on natural disasters. By making this information available and easy to understand, we aim to foster informed decision-making and encourage proactive measures towards building resilient infrastructure.

### Features

- **Data Layers**: The map includes separate layers for counties and congressional districts, which can be toggled on or off to customize the viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The web map is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
